Mouse trap

the way I implemented interactions is with 3 main interactions, with subsequential sub interactions to give the player
some agency. The 3 main triggers are between "paper" and "nail", "sawdust" and "crumbs", and "newspaper" and "cat",
each of with has a bad outcome and a good outcome. which impact your final score at the end.

the scoring system is based around the amount of food you collect throughout the house, and the amount of times you get hurt or experence a conseqence, +10 for each food item, -10 for each time you get chased by the house cat, or clip a nail.

I added a couple of locks you can't complete the game without finding, most are trigged through the right interaction or by collecting an item and bringing it to the right location.
